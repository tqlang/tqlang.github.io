# Loops
:::under-construction

Complex programs aways needs to do repetitive or infinite tasks. Because of it,
loops must be used. Loops are structures used to repeat a selected code section
until some condition is reached. Bellow are the loop types that the language supports:

---
## While loops

While loops are the most basic loop types. It while it conditional is valid or
the code reaches a breakpoint.

These are the possibilities for the while statement syntax:
```pseudo
while <condition> do <instruction>
while <condition> : <step> do <instruction>
while <declaration> : <condition> : <step> do <instruction>
```
`declaration` - Context variables that will be accessible inside the loop
`condition` - The boolean value that will be tested before each iteration. The loop will continue running while this is true
`step` - A process to be executed after each loop iteration
`instruction` - what the loop should do every iteration

While loops are the most common way to do repetitive tasks in tq. it behave both like while and for loops in
the majority of other languages.

```c title="In C"
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
	puts("Hello, Scopped World!")
}
puts("Loop break")
```
```tq title="In tq"
#/// func scope ///
while i = 0 : index < 5 : i++ do {
	Std.Console.log("Hello, Scopped World!")
}
Std.Console.log("Loop break")
```
```text title="Console Output"
Hello, Scopped World!
Hello, Scopped World!
Hello, Scopped World!
Hello, Scopped World!
Hello, Scopped World!
Loop break
```

Using a `break` statement, it is possible to stop the loop before its condition fails:
```tq
#/// func scope ///
let index = 10
while index >= 0 do {
	Std.Console.log("Hello, Scopped World!")
	index -= 2

	if index < 5 break
}
Std.Console.writeln(index)
```
```text title="Console Output"
Hello, Scopped World!
Hello, Scopped World!
Hello, Scopped World!
4
```

Using `:` is also possible to define an extra step for the loop to do
after each iteration:

```tq
#/// func scope ///
# Parenthesis are optional, but may helps to read!
let index = 0
while (index < 10) : (index++) do Std.Console.log("Hello, World!")
```

## For loops
:::not-implemented

// TODO

```tq
from Std.Console import

func ... {
	# Looping from 0 to 49
	for i in ..50 do writeln(i)

	# Looping from 0 to 50 in steps of 10
	for i in ..50:10 do writeln(i)

	# Looping though each element of a array
	let []byte numbers = [22, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43]
	for v in numbers do {
		write("Example of a prime number:")
		writeln(v)
	}
}
```
