# Loops
:::under-construction

Complex programs aways needs to do repetitive or infinite tasks. Because of it,
loops must be used. Loops are structures used to repeat a selected code section
until some condition is reached. Bellow are the loop types that abstract supports:

---
## While loops

While loops are the most basic loop types. It while it conditional is valid or
the code reaches a breakpoint.

These are the possibilities for the while statement syntax:
```abs
while <condition> do <instruction>
while <condition> : <step> do <instruction>
while <declaration> : <condition> : <step> do <instruction>
```
`declaration` - Context variables that will be accessible inside the loop
`condition` - The boolean value that will be tested before each iteration. The loop will continue running while this is true
`step` - A process to be executed after each loop iteration
`instruction` - what the loop should do every iteration

While loops are the most common way to do repetitive tasks in Abstract. it behave both like while and for loops in
the majority of other languages.

```c title="In C"
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
	puts("Hello, Scopped World!")
}
puts("Loop break")
```
```abs title="In Abstract"
while let i = 0 : index < 5 : i++ do {
	Std.Console.log("Hello, Scopped World!")
}
Std.Console.log("Loop break")
```
```text title="Console Output"
Hello, Scopped World!
Hello, Scopped World!
Hello, Scopped World!
Hello, Scopped World!
Hello, Scopped World!
Loop break
```

Using a `break` statement, it is possible to stop the loop before its condition fails:
```abs
let index = 10
while index >= 0 do {
	Std.Console.log("Hello, Scopped World!")
	index -= 2

	if index < 5 break
}
Std.Console.writeln(index)
```
```text title="Console Output"
Hello, Scopped World!
Hello, Scopped World!
Hello, Scopped World!
4
```

Using `:` is also possible to define an extra step for the loop to do
after each iteration:

```abs
# Parenthesis are optional, but helps to read!
let index = 0
while (index < 10) : (index++) do Std.Console.log("Hello, World!")
```

---
## For loops
:::not-implemented

// TODO

```abs
from Std.Console import

# Looping from 0 to 49
for i in ..50 do writeln(i)

# Looping from 0 to 50 in steps of 10
for i in ..50:10 do writeln(i)

# Looping though each element of a array
let []byte numbers = [22, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43]
for v in numbers do {
	write("Example of a prime number:")
	writeln(v)
}
```
