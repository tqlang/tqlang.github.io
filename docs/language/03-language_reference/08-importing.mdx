# Importing Modules and Namespaces

Importing allows to use references outside the current script
and scope. Abstract offers different ways to import diferent
references as needed for the user and in a way to allow the
readability of the code.

## Importing namespaces

simple imports can be done by writing:
```pseudo
from <namespace> import
```

Being `<namespace>` the relative or global reference to a namespace
that is desired to import.

A example of simple import is:
```tq
from Std.Console import
```

Simple imports will allow the code to directly access references of
the imported namespace is if inside it:

```tq
from Std.Console import

func main() !void {
	# `writeln` is not a member of the `MyProgram` namespace,
	# in reality it is being imported from `Std.Console`!
	writeln("Hello, World!")
}
```

---
## Specifiing Imports

Sometimes, is not necessary to import a entire namespace or doing so
can cause a conflict with another member. Because of it, Abstract
allows to specify what is being imported to the current scope with the
syntax:

```pseudo
from <namespace> import { <ref...> }
```

Being `<namespace>` the parent of the desired imported content and
`<ref...>` the references, separated by comma, of the desired members
of the refered namespace.

Doing it also will not only import the desired content, as well scope
the content of what is being imported inside a reference of the same name.

e. g.:
```tq
from Std import { Console, Memory }
# `Console` and `Memory` is now directly referenceable


func main() !void {
	Console.writeln("Hello, World!")
}

```

```tq
from Std.Console import { write }
# only the `write` function is being imported


func main() !void  {
	write("Hello, World, ")
	# Other references still need to be refered
	# from the root!
	Std.Console.writeln("I'm importing references!")
}
```


---
## Import with alias

To avoid reference conflicts or have control about the imported reference,
is still possible to renemed it as desired using the keyword `as` as follows:

```tq
from Std.Console import { write, writeln as writeLine }

func main() !void {
	write("Hello, World, ")
	# Instead of refering as `writeln`, the function is
	# refered as `writeLine`!
	writeLine("I'm importing references!")
}
```
