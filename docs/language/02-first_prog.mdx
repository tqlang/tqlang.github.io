# Creating Your First Program
:::under-construction
:::


This document will help you how to set up tq tools in your
machine as well as how to create, organize and execute your first
program.

---
## Setting up the environment

TODO

To start a new project, begin creating a new directory folder that
will be used as the root namespace. For this example, let's call
the folder `MyProgram.

```shell title="Command Line"
mkdir MyProgram
cd MyProgram
```

---
## Writing the program

Inside the `MyProgram` folder, create a script file with the
`.tq` extension e.g., `main.tq`.

Inside the script file, write the following code:
```tq title="main.tq"
from Std.Console import

func main() !void {
	writeln("Hello, World!")
	writeln("I'm coding in tq!")
}
```

---
## Running the Program

The language offers two ways to build and run the program: Using
thecommand line to directly call the compiler or use a build script
to talk to the compiler for you.

### Building with the command line

Using the command line, you can invoke the following command to run the
project in the current workspace:

```shell title="Command Line"
tqc build run
```

### Running With a Build Automatization Script

To use a build automatization script, create a new script that should
be called `build.tq`.

This is an example of a standard for the file and directory organization
for using build automatization scripts:

```text title="MyProgram/"
src/
 '- main.tq
build.tq
```

the creation of this istructure can be automatized though the command:
```shell title="Command Line"
abs init
```
